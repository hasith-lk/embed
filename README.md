# Embedded Coding repo

This repo contains the embedded codes written for STM32 MCPU and for Arduino boards.
Some simple stuff that will be used to perform IO operations using microcontroller unit.

codes are compiled for ARM Cortex M3 architecture but can used with other Cortex M architectures. However codes are using STM32 libraries so can ported only inbetween STM32 microprocessors.
